# Golf Score Tracking App �️

A Python Flask web application for tracking golf scores across multiple players and custom courses. The app runs locally and provies a browser-based interface for easy score input and round tracking.

##  Features

- Track scores for individual or multiple players
- Uses a local popular course complete with yardages and pin placements
- Automatically calculate total scores and determine winner
- Save round data for future reference
- User-friendly

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **SQLite3** 
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cybersecure35/Golf_App.git
   cd Golf_App

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## What I Learned
• Implementing object-oriented structure for managing players and courses

• Using SQLite to persist game data

• Handling edge cases and invalid user input gracefully


## Future Improvements
• Add support for exporting scorecards as PDFs
• Integrate weather API to display real-time weather during gameplay
